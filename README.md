## Overview

Before Running the Code

- Create the following subfolders in your project directory: do, data, createdata, log, and output

- Change the file path for the global folder (`gl folder`) in `00_master.do` to the location of the project folder

Once these changes have been made, running `00_master.do` will produce the data and figures corresponding to the selected sections (noted in each local in the 00_master.do).

Register for access to the HRS and RAND HRS data on the HRS website  
(https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products), then download the following files (both `.dct` and `.da`, or `.dta` where noted):

- **RAND HRS Fat Files**: `ad95f2b`, `h96f4a`, `hd98f2c`, `h00f1d`, `h02f2c`, `h04f1c`, `h06f3a`, `h08f3a`, `hd10f5f`, `h12f3a`, `h14f2b`, `h16f2c`, `h18f2b`
