## Overview
Before running the code:
Copy file contents into the project folder with the following subfolders: do, data, createddata, log, and output
Change the file path of the folder global (&quot;gl folder&quot;) in 00_master.do to the location of the project folder

Once these changes have been made, running the master file will produce the data and figures corresponding to the selected sections (noted after each local in 00_master.do).
