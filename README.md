## Overview

Before Running the Code

- Create the following subfolders in your project directory: do, data, createdata, log, and output

- Change the file path for the global folder (`gl folder`) in `00_master.do` to the location of the project folder

Once these changes have been made, running `00_master.do` will produce the data and figures corresponding to the selected sections (noted in each local in the 00_master.do).
